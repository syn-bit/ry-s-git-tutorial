# Ry's GIT tutorial

This repository contains "Ry's GIT tutorial" and associated files, as they are not hosted by Ryan Hodson himself anymore. I also created a compilation of the "Quick References" and added a couple of useful links to GIT related stuff.

- The tutorial itself was downloaded from [smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/498426 "Ry's GIT tutorial").
- I also [tracked down](https://hamwaves.com/collaboration/doc/rypress.com/index.html "The ZIp files") the mentioned ZIP files with the demo repository in all the stages.
- As I find the quick notes in the tutorial handy, I compiled them into a txt file and into an Excel sheet. Enjoy!
- Have a look at [gitviz](https://github.com/riezebosch/gitviz "gitviz"), a graphical representation of your repository, great for visualizing and learning the inner workings of git
- Want to practice? Have a look at [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/ "Learn Git Branching")
- Git GUI [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ "Sourcetree")
- [Git Repo cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ "Git repo Cleaner")
- [Github flow model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ "Github flow")
